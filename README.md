# i present to you: the lowercasinator!!!   
some goofass code i made to turn almost every string of text lowercase   
if there's anything that i missed, please bug me until i fix it :3

## "ok so how the fuck do i install this?"
betterdiscord users should download the "lowercasinator.theme.css" file and upload it to their themes   
vencord users can do the above, or they copypaste the below link in their Online Themes list   
replugged users have installed replugged, they're probably not the type to use this kind of dumbfuck theme anyway   
## "uhhh i don't like that some specific kind of text is lowercased how do i undo that"   
nerd   
i suggest you manually copy the exception list found at the bottom [the source file which is for some fucked up reason called "mingefuck.css"](https://github.com/modraws/lowercasinator/blob/main/mingefuck.css), and paste it into your quickcss or custom css thingy idk  
that way you can change which strings of text are locked to lowercase
