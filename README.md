# i present to you: the lowercasinator!!!   
some goofass code i made to turn almost every string of text lowercase   
if there's anything that i missed, please bug me until i fix it :3  
and uh if things break, just know it's usually My Fault because I'm Smart and Can Do Things

## "ok so how the fuck do i install this?"
betterdiscord users should download the "lowercasinator.theme.css" file and upload it to their themes   
vencord users can do the above, or they copy-paste the below link to their Online Themes list   
[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/modraws/lowercasinator/refs/heads/main/lowercasinator.theme.css](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/modraws/lowercasinator/refs/heads/main/lowercasinator.theme.css)   
replugged users have installed replugged, they're probably not the type to use this kind of dumbfuck theme anyway   
## "uhhh i don't like that some specific kind of text is lowercased how do i undo that"   
nerd   
i suggest you manually copy the exception list found at the bottom [the source file which is for some fucked up reason called "mingefuck.css"](https://github.com/modraws/lowercasinator/blob/main/mingefuck.css), and paste it into your quickcss or custom css thingy idk  
that way you can change which strings of text are locked to lowercase
